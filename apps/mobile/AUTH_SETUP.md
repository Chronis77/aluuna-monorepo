# 🔐 Authentication System Integration

Your React Native app now uses the new Railway-based authentication system instead of Supabase Auth!

## ✅ What's Been Updated

1. **AuthContext** - Now uses JWT tokens with refresh functionality
2. **Login Screen** - Uses new `/api/auth/login` endpoint
3. **Register Screen** - Uses new `/api/auth/signup` endpoint
4. **Token Storage** - Secure AsyncStorage with automatic refresh
5. **API Integration** - Direct HTTP calls to your Railway server

## 🚀 How It Works

- **Login/Signup** → Gets JWT token + refresh token
- **Token Storage** → Securely stored in AsyncStorage
- **API Calls** → Automatically includes Bearer token
- **Token Refresh** → Automatic when token expires
- **Logout** → Clears all tokens and calls logout endpoint

## 🔧 Environment Setup

Your existing environment configuration already works! The app uses:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_SERVER_URL` (for development)
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` (for production)

These are already configured in your `mobile-env.example` file.

## 🧪 Testing

1. **Start your Railway server** (if not already running)
2. **Run your React Native app**
3. **Try signing up** with a new account
4. **Try logging in** with existing credentials
5. **Test the logout** functionality

## 🔄 Migration Notes

- ✅ **Existing screens** - No changes needed
- ✅ **Existing navigation** - Works as before
- ✅ **Existing UI components** - All preserved
- ✅ **Token management** - Now more secure with refresh tokens
- ✅ **Error handling** - Improved with better error messages

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Better Security** - JWT tokens with automatic refresh
2. **Faster Performance** - Direct API calls to Railway
3. **Better Error Handling** - More detailed error messages
4. **Automatic Token Management** - No manual token handling needed
5. **Consistent with Backend** - Uses the same auth system as your server

Your app is now fully integrated with the new Railway authentication system! 🚀
