# Voice Input Setup

## Current Status

**Voice recording is now available on all platforms!** ✅

- ✅ **Web**: Full voice recording and transcription support
- ✅ **iOS**: Full voice recording and transcription support  
- ✅ **Android**: Full voice recording and transcription support

## Platform Support

The app now uses `expo-av` for cross-platform audio recording, providing:
- Real-time audio visualization with animated waves
- High-quality audio recording
- OpenAI Whisper API integration for transcription
- Proper permission handling on all platforms

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key:

```bash
# No OpenAI key needed on mobile; server-side TTS handles authentication via JWT
```

### 2. OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key and paste it in your `.env` file

### 3. Restart Development Server

After setting up the environment variables, restart your development server:

```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

## Technical Details

### Audio Library

The app uses `expo-av` for audio recording, which provides:
- **Cross-platform support**: Works on iOS, Android, and Web
- **High-quality recording**: Uses platform-optimized audio settings
- **Real-time metering**: Provides audio level data for visualizations
- **Permission handling**: Automatic microphone permission requests

### Features

- **Real-time wave animations**: Visual feedback based on audio input
- **Smart noise filtering**: Only animates when actual speech is detected
- **Whisper API integration**: High-quality speech-to-text transcription
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for various error conditions
- **Platform-specific optimizations**: Tailored settings for each platform

### Recording Process

1. **Permission Request**: App requests microphone access
2. **Audio Mode Setup**: Configures audio session for recording
3. **Recording Start**: Begins high-quality audio capture
4. **Real-time Visualization**: Waves animate based on audio levels
5. **Recording Stop**: Stops capture and prepares for transcription
6. **Whisper API Call**: Sends audio to OpenAI for transcription
7. **Text Output**: Returns transcribed text to input field

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted when prompted
- On iOS, check Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone
- On Android, check app permissions in device settings

### Recording Not Working
1. Check that your `.env` file exists and has the correct API key
2. Restart the development server with `--clear` flag
3. Check console for any error messages
4. Ensure microphone permissions are granted

### Transcription Issues
- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Check that the key starts with `sk-`
- Ensure the key has access to the Whisper API
- Check internet connection for API calls

### Audio Quality Issues
- Speak clearly and at a normal volume
- Minimize background noise
- Ensure microphone is not blocked
- Try recording in a quiet environment
