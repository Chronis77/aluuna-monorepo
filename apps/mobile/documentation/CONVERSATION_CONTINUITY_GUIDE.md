# Session Continuity Guide for Aluuna

## üîÑ **The Problem**
When users log back into Aluuna and return to an existing session, the AI needs to know:
- Where they left off in their therapeutic journey
- What phase of the session they were in
- What themes they were exploring
- How to appropriately welcome them back

## üéØ **The Solution: Session Continuity Management**

Aluuna now tracks session progress and provides intelligent continuity when users return to sessions.

## üìä **How Session Continuity Works**

### **1. Session Progress Tracking**
The system tracks for each session:
- **Message Count**: How many messages into the session
- **Session Phase**: start, early, mid, late, ending
- **Therapeutic Focus**: What they were working on
- **Emotional State**: How they were feeling
- **Timestamp**: When they last interacted

### **2. Resume Detection**
- **Time Threshold**: 5+ minutes = resuming session
- **Smart Detection**: Distinguishes between brief pauses and actual breaks
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains therapeutic progress

### **3. Continuity Guidance**
The AI receives specific guidance on how to handle resuming users:
- **Acknowledge the break** warmly and understandingly
- **Reconnect** to where they left off
- **Continue therapeutic work** from their last phase
- **Maintain rapport** and trust

## üïê **Session Continuity Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Brief Pause (< 5 minutes)**
```
User: "I've been feeling overwhelmed with work lately"
AI: [Responds normally]
User: [5 minutes later] "And I think it's affecting my relationships"
AI: "I hear that connection you're making between work stress and your relationships. Can you tell me more about how that's showing up?"
```
**AI Behavior**: Continues naturally, no special handling needed

### **Scenario 2: Session Resume (> 5 minutes)**
```
User: "I've been feeling overwhelmed with work lately"
AI: [Responds normally]
User: [30 minutes later] "I'm back, sorry about that"
AI: "Welcome back! I'm glad you're here. We were just exploring how work stress has been affecting you. How are you feeling now, and would you like to continue where we left off?"
```
**AI Behavior**: Acknowledges break, reconnects to previous work

### **Scenario 3: Deep Work Resume**
```
User: "I think my childhood trauma is affecting my relationships"
AI: [Deep therapeutic work]
User: [2 hours later] "I had to step away for a bit"
AI: "I understand, and I'm here for you. We were doing some important work around how your childhood experiences are showing up in your relationships now. That's sensitive territory - how are you feeling about continuing that exploration, or would you prefer to focus on something else right now?"
```
**AI Behavior**: Acknowledges the deep work, offers choice about continuing

## üß† **AI Continuity Intelligence**

### **Session Phase Awareness**
The AI knows what phase the user was in and adapts accordingly:

#### **Start Phase Resume**
- **Context**: User was just beginning to share
- **AI Response**: "Welcome back! I'm here to listen. How are you feeling now?"
- **Focus**: Re-establishing rapport and safety

#### **Early Phase Resume**
- **Context**: User was building rapport and sharing initial concerns
- **AI Response**: "Good to see you again. We were just starting to explore [topic]. How are you feeling about that now?"
- **Focus**: Reconnecting to initial themes

#### **Mid Phase Resume**
- **Context**: User was in deep therapeutic exploration
- **AI Response**: "Welcome back. We were doing some important work around [theme]. How does that feel to reconnect with?"
- **Focus**: Continuing therapeutic work

#### **Late Phase Resume**
- **Context**: User was integrating insights and preparing closure
- **AI Response**: "I'm glad you're back. We were working on integrating some insights about [theme]. How does that feel now?"
- **Focus**: Continuing integration work

#### **Ending Phase Resume**
- **Context**: User was near session completion
- **AI Response**: "Welcome back! We were wrapping up our work on [theme]. How does that feel to you now?"
- **Focus**: Completing integration or continuing if needed

### **Emotional State Continuity**
The AI remembers how the user was feeling and adapts:

#### **Crisis Resume**
- **Context**: User was in crisis when they left
- **AI Response**: "I'm here for you. How are you feeling now? Are you safe?"
- **Focus**: Safety and current state assessment

#### **Overwhelmed Resume**
- **Context**: User was feeling overwhelmed
- **AI Response**: "Welcome back. I know we were working with some heavy feelings. How are you doing now?"
- **Focus**: Current emotional state and containment

#### **Positive Resume**
- **Context**: User was experiencing positive insights
- **AI Response**: "Great to see you again! We were celebrating some important insights. How does that feel now?"
- **Focus**: Building on positive momentum

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Session Continuity Manager**
```typescript
// Track session progress
SessionContinuityManager.trackSessionProgress(
  sessionId,
  messageCount,
  sessionPhase,
  therapeuticFocus,
  emotionalState
);

// Check if resuming
const resumeContext = SessionContinuityManager.checkSessionResume(sessionId);
```

### **Continuity-Aware Prompts**
The AI receives specific guidance based on resume context:
- **Resume Status**: Is user resuming or continuing?
- **Time Since Last Message**: How long they were away
- **Previous Session Phase**: Where they left off
- **Continuity Guidance**: How to handle the resume

### **Structured Response Integration**
The structured response includes continuity information:
```json
{
  "session_continuity": "resuming|continuing",
  "session_timing": "start|early|mid|late|ending",
  "response": "AI response with continuity awareness"
}
```

## üìà **Benefits of Session Continuity**

### **For Users**

```

### **Flow 3: Crisis Support**
