- One record per user

### `insights`
- Stores individual insights with importance levels and themes
- Multiple records per user
- **Managed separately** in the dedicated Insights screen

### `inner_parts`
- Stores identified inner parts with roles and descriptions
- Multiple records per user

### `memory_snapshots`
- Stores session summaries with key themes
- Multiple records per user

### `crisis_flags`

- Multiple records per user

## Technical Implementation

### Memory Processing Service
The `MemoryProcessingService` class handles:
- Storing structured responses from AI conversations
- Retrieving memory data for display
- Managing different memory item types

### Memory Profile Screen
The memory profile screen (`app/memory-profile.tsx`) provides:
