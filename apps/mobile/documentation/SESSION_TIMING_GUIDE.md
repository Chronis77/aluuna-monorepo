## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Message Counting**

### **Dynamic Adaptation**
The AI automatically:

## üìà **Example Session Flow**

### **Message 1 (Session Start)**
```
User: "I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately"
AI: "I hear that you've been carrying a heavy load. It takes courage to share that. Can you tell me more about what's been feeling overwhelming for you?"
```

### **Message 4 (Mid Session)**
```
User: "I think it's because I'm trying to be everything for everyone"
AI: "That's such an important insight. I'm hearing how you've been taking on so much responsibility for others. What do you notice about that pattern in your life?"
```

### **Message 8 (Late Session)**
```
User: "I guess I learned that from my family growing up"
AI: "That makes so much sense - you learned early on that your worth came from taking care of others. How does that pattern show up for you now, and what would it feel like to begin setting some boundaries?"
```

### **Message 12 (Session Ending)**
```
User: "I think I need to start saying no more often"
AI: "That's a powerful realization. You're recognizing that you have the right to set boundaries and take care of yourself. What would be one small step you could take this week to practice that?"
```
