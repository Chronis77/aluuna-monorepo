# Testing Function Calling Implementation

## Mobile App Readiness ✅

The mobile app is fully configured and ready for server-side function calling. Here's what's already working:

### 1. **tRPC Endpoints Available** ✅
All the necessary endpoints exist in `lib/trpcClient.ts`:
- `createMantra()` ✅
- `addCopingTool()` ✅ 
- `createRelationship()` ✅
- `addGoal()` ✅
- `addTheme()` ✅
- `addEmotionalState()` ✅
- `getInsights()` ✅

### 2. **UI Pages Ready** ✅
- **Mantras Page**: `app/mantras.tsx` - will show AI-created mantras
- **Memory Profile**: `app/memory-profile.tsx` - will show coping tools, themes, etc.
- **Relationships**: `app/relationships.tsx` - will show AI-tracked relationships
- **Insights**: `app/insights.tsx` - will show captured insights

### 3. **WebSocket Communication** ✅
- Routes to server: `https://aluuna-services-production.up.railway.app`
- Handles streaming responses ✅
- No metadata parsing (clean responses) ✅

### 4. **AI Prompts Updated** ✅
- Removed metadata requirements ✅
- Added function calling instructions ✅
- Natural tool usage guidance ✅

## Testing Scenarios

Once the server implements function calling, test these conversations:

### Test 1: Mantra Creation
**User**: "I'm struggling with self-doubt today"
**Expected AI Response**: "I hear you're struggling with self-doubt. Let me create a mantra that might help... I'm adding 'I trust in my abilities and inner wisdom' to your mantra collection. You can find it in your Mantras section when you need that reminder."

### Test 2: Coping Tool Recording  
**User**: "Deep breathing really helps when I'm anxious"
**Expected AI Response**: "That's wonderful that you've found deep breathing helpful! Let me record this coping tool for you... I've added 'Deep breathing exercises' to your toolkit as a mindfulness technique for anxiety. You can reference this in your Memory Profile."

### Test 3: Insight Capture
**User**: "I just realized I always people-please when I'm afraid of conflict"
**Expected AI Response**: "That's such an important insight about people-pleasing and conflict avoidance! I'm recording this realization in your profile... This pattern recognition will help us explore your relationship dynamics in future sessions."

### Test 4: Relationship Tracking
**User**: "My partner Sarah has been really supportive through this difficult time"
**Expected AI Response**: "It's beautiful that Sarah is providing such support during a challenging period. I'm adding her to your relationships as an important source of support... Having this context will help me better understand your support system."

### Test 5: Multiple Tools
**User**: "I want to work on being more patient with myself. Maybe a daily reminder would help"
**Expected AI Response**: "Self-patience is such a valuable goal to work on. I'm adding 'Practice self-patience daily' to your goals... I'm also creating a mantra for you: 'I give myself the same kindness I would give a dear friend.' You'll find both in your toolkit to support this intention."

## How to Verify

### 1. Check Database
After each conversation, verify in your database that the data was saved:
- Mantras table should have new entries
- Memory profile should show new coping tools
- Relationships should be recorded
- Goals and themes should appear

### 2. Check Mobile App
Navigate to these sections and verify data appears:
- **Mantras page**: Should show AI-created mantras immediately
- **Memory Profile**: Should show coping tools, themes, insights
- **Relationships**: Should show people the AI learned about

### 3. Real-time Updates
The mobile app should show new data immediately without needing to refresh, since it uses tRPC for real-time data fetching.

## Current Status

✅ **Mobile app is 100% ready for function calling**
⏳ **Server needs to implement the OpenAI function calling logic**

Once the server is updated with the implementation guide, the AI will start naturally creating mantras, recording coping tools, capturing insights, and building the user's therapeutic toolkit in real-time during conversations.
