Please test the core features of Aluuna, our emotional journaling companion. Specifically, we’re looking for feedback on:

Voice and text input – Can you record or type thoughts easily?

Conversational response – Does the AI feel warm, supportive, and insightful?

Memory continuity – Does the app feel like it remembers previous sessions?

Tracking - Are the mantra's, memories, insights, etc. relevant to you. 

Insights – Are summaries or responses helping you reflect or feel supported?

Overall experience – Is anything confusing, frustrating, or especially delightful?

General usability – Are there any confusing screens, bugs, or performance issues?

This is a soft launch, so any feedback, small or big, is hugely appreciated. Feel free to explore the app naturally and report anything that feels off or unclear.

To give feedback, just tap the bug icon in the top-right corner. It will open a form directly in the app. Thank you so much for helping us shape Aluuna into something truly meaningful.
